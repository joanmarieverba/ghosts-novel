                    </p><h5><p>
                    Charlene Griffin never thought she'd be without a home. But when she's kicked out on her eighteenth birthday, she has no
                    choice but to sleep inside an ominous Victorian mansion. And with the owner offering the estate to anyone who can spend
                    a full night in the haunted property, Charlene decides to risk life and limb to get off the streets.
                    </p><p>
                    Refusing to heed the warnings of those sent running in fear for their lives, Charlene is confident she can last from
                    sunset to sunrise. But she'll need all her wits about her to withstand the hours of terror, because these ghosts are
                    determined to get rid of her.
                    </p><p>
                    Will Charlene outsmart her supernatural foes and make it to dawn?
                    </p><p>
                    <em>Defying the Ghosts</em> is an eerie YA haunted house story. If you like heart-racing action, fearless heroes, and survival
                    adventures, then you'll love Joan Marie Verba's thrilling tale.

                    A ghost needs space to haunt, and a teenager kicked out of the house by a mother unable to love, lacking money for a
                    rental, and looking for a safe place to stay doesn't have it to offer. But the haunted house offered to Charlene if she
                    can last the night has lost its original family, driven other would-be claimants out by the aggressive late residents,
                    and Charlene is too determined to give up on the only option she's been able to find. Instead of exorcisms or high-tech
                    spirit guns firing special-effects rays, she tries a simpler method for dealing with ghostly threats: compassion, fueled
                    by stubbornness and courage. Joan Marie Verba's <em>Defying the Ghosts</em> offers the eerie dangers expected of ghosts, but
                    works through to a slime-less conclusion offering an elegant win to both the living and the dead. &mdash;Ruth Berman,

                            Defying the Ghosts by Joan Marie Verba tells the suspenseful story of a young woman's creepy night in a
                            haunted house. After her mother kicks her out of her house on her eighteenth birthday, Charlene spends the next few weeks
                            scouting homeless shelters and camping out in the back room of the bookstore where she works. Charlene thinks she
                            might be in luck when she hears of a challenge: anyone who can spend the entire night in the local haunted house gets to
                            keep the house. It seems simple enough, but Charlene will soon risk her life on the most horrifying night of her life
                            as she faces the multiple ghosts who do not want anyone else in their home.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            For any reader who is looking for a new kind of horror story, Defying the Ghosts is a great choice for both
                            teens and adults. I never knew it was possible to write a book that was simultaneously terrifying and heartwarming,
                            but Joan Marie Verba has flawlessly managed to do just that. Charlene's story is eye-opening and brings to light the
                            everyday problems and prejudices that...people face when they are trying to survive. The spooky moments of the haunted
                            house are fast-paced, suspenseful, and overall fun to read. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time Charlene was
                            in the house, and I could not put the book down. I can't wait to see what other horror tales Verba has in store.

                                <strong class="underln">Plot:</strong> Homeless and desperate, eighteen-year-old Charlene Griffin must spend the night alone in a Victorian mansion of
                                terrors in order to earn the right to claim the property as her future home. This YA novel is as much about resiliency
                                as it is about ghosts. The minutiae of Charlene's situation--being a homeless teen--are described realistically. While
                                spending the night in the haunted house Charlene encounters plenty of snakes, unexplained thuds, disembodied voices,
                                fire, unexpected physical limitations, and, yes, ghosts, which she confronts with intelligence and courage. The ghosts
                                serve to create the terror necessary for a horror story, but they are also metaphors for emotional rites of passage in
                                this hero's quest for autonomy and maturity.<br/>

                                <strong class="underln">Prose/Style:</strong> This is an easy read for anyone with middle school reading abilities, and the action and huge cast of
                                ghosts and their histories makes the novel interesting.... <br />

                                exposition on children and parents, what parents' obligations to their children are, and what happens when parents fail
                                to meet those responsibilities.<br />

                                her difficult situation and do what is necessary to deal with it is admirable. She is a great role model for preteens
                                and early teens.<br />
