                Charlene Griffin never thought she’d be without a home. But when she’s kicked out on her eighteenth birthday, she has no

                a full night in the haunted property, Charlene decides to risk life and limb to get off the streets.
                
                Refusing to heed the warnings of those sent running in fear for their lives, Charlene is confident she can last from
                sunset to sunrise. But she’ll need all her wits about her to withstand the hours of terror, because these ghosts are
                determined to get rid of her.
                
                Will Charlene outsmart her supernatural foes and make it to dawn?

                A ghost needs space to haunt, and a teenager kicked out of the house by a mother unable to love, lacking money for a
                rental, and looking for a safe place to stay doesn’t have it to offer. But the haunted house offered to Charlene if she
                can last the night has lost its original family, driven other would-be claimants out by the aggressive late residents,
                and Charlene is too determined to give up on the only option she’s been able to find. Instead of exorcisms or high-tech
                spirit guns firing special-effects rays, she tries a simpler method for dealing with ghostly threats: compassion, fueled
                by stubbornness and courage. Joan Marie Verba’s Defying the Ghosts offers the eerie dangers expected of ghosts, but
                works through to a slime-less conclusion offering an elegant win to both the living and the dead.
